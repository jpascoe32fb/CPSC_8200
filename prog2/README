The current makefile is used for testing the optimized code function mmOpt.cu

To run:
make run

To test the other implementations, change the corresponding makefile to be the one in use
(ie. Makefile_cublas is used to test the mmCUBLAS.cpp implementation
     Makefile_naive is used to test the mmNaive.cu implementation)
     
To change the makefile to be the proper one, rename the current file called Makefile to something else
(ie. current to Makefile_opt) 
and then rename one of the others to simply Makefile.
